#Lab 2: Web Fundamentals and Assistive Technologies

## Question 1- HTML 

You are provided with HTML code that contains errors including unclosed paragraph tags, missing image alt attributes, and an unclosed unordered list. These errors can make it challenging for people using assistive technology to properly interpret the content. Your task is to identify and correct these errors in the HTML code. 
Once fixed, use the Markup Validation Service to validate the code (switch to validate by direct input).

## Question 2- CSS
Your code contains an image and a list of links, but their accessibility is currently poor. The image is being used to display text, which can be problematic for users relying on screen readers. Additionally, there is no clear indication that the list items are links, and it's difficult to determine which link the user is currently focused on. 

## Question 3- CSS & HTML

The content you have includes a button with improper semantics. Therefore, it is not recognized by screen readers. In addition, the background & text color are hard to see for persons with low vision.

Tool to practice: Use Colour Contrast Analyser (CCA) to address the color contrast issue. Select a different color combination that pass the accessibility standards “WCAG 2.1 1.4.3 Contrast AA contrast ratio.” Tutorial: How to use Color Contrast Analyser (video, 2m 33s) 

## Question 4- JavaScript
You are provided with a button that displays text when the user hovers the mouse pointer over it. Keyboard only users must be able to display the text using the keyboard without needing to use a mouse.
